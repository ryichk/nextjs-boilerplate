# Next.js Boilerplate

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Features

- ðŸŽ‰ [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for Static Site Generator

- ðŸ”§ Type checking [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

- ðŸ’š Integrate with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

- âœ¨ Code Formatter with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

- ðŸš¨ Linter with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

- âœ… Testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

- ðŸŽ¨ Build a design system with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

- ðŸš€ Deploy with [AWS Amplify](https://docs.amplify.aws/guides/hosting/nextjs/q/platform/js/)

## Requirements

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

- Next.js App: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

- Storybook: [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006)

## Development

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:8000/api/hello](http://localhost:8000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
